 This repository has a weather app that fetches current location weather based on geolocation and also displays weather based on search of the user.
OpenWeatherMap api is used for the fetching weather based on searches of the user.

Further improvements:
1. This is a laptop only website , so I am planning to add configs for mobile devices also.

For any other improvements please raise a pull request if you think of any and if it suits the agenda of the project will surely merge it.
